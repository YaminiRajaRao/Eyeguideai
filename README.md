# EyeGuide AI üíªüëÅÔ∏è - An AI Assistive Tool for the Visually Impaired

## Project Overview
EyeGuide AI is a cutting-edge tool designed to assist visually impaired individuals by providing them with real-time visual and contextual understanding. Using advanced image processing, OCR, and natural language processing techniques, EyeGuide AI can describe scenes, extract text from images, detect obstacles and objects, and provide personalized assistance based on the content of the image.

## Features
- **Scene Understanding**  
  Get a description of the visual scene to assist with navigation and awareness of surroundings.

## Technology Stack
- **Image Processing**: The tool uses **Tesseract OCR** for text extraction from images.
- **Generative AI**: Powered by **Google Gemini** model for scene analysis and description generation.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Utilizes **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech) to convert text into speech for easy understanding.
- **User Interface**: Built using **Streamlit**, a simple web app framework for Python.
